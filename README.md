Created as a student project using OpenStreetMaps API, OpenWeather API & Rainviewer API, all of which are free to use.

Tools used: React, React Leaflet, React Router, React Icons, React Papaparse, React Select, Axios, Tailwind CSS

This project has helped me understand the basics of React, calling APIs in React, how to use the React Router efficiently and how to organise files in React
